The report invloves Thermo-Optic analysis of metal-microheater integrated silicon waveguide phase-shifter
First section is the Thermal steady state simulation, which is the study of the sensitivity parameter of the device bases on geometric parameters and steady state temperature of the waveguide vs input power consumption of the metal microheater.
Second section is the transient charecteristics i.e the temperature evolution profile of the SOI waveguide core w.r.t time.
Third section is the numberical analysis of the optical loss involved due to the proximity of the metal strip aroud the waveguide leading to coupeling of the evanecent tail of the guided mode.
Last section is a brief description about how the project can be extendeed to Lumerical INTERCONNECT simulation of the entier circuit and also the future prospects in general of the Programmable Photonic Integrated circuits.
